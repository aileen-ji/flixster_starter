### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, all except the stretch feature of popups which was rather hard for me. Making the popup look nice was also hard.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added more css animations to my site to enhance user experience. I would also have positioned the backdrop posters better.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was able to show most of my features, and a lot of people liked the mode switch! I want to add filtered searches and error handling.
